# pdf-to-image-converter-v1.0
It is a pdf to image convertor. Fully free to use. Please read the instructions first.<br>
Before running this program install pdf2image by running this code in your command prompt:
<code>pip install pdf2image</code><br>
You can also know more about pdf2image module and it's installation process from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/">pypi.org</a><br>
Now run this code. In my case, I cannot run it directly. So I use spyder. I need to run <code>pip install pdf2image</code> inside spyder and then the program works fine.
It gives a very accurate result for 5 pages pdf. You can try for other and <b>give the feedback</b>. I am working for its improvement. And hopefully in v1.1 I can give you a better PDF to Image Converter.
